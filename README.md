# FOSS Training Project

Open Source Physical Training Management System.

## Project Proposal

The goal of this project is to provide a free and open-source solution for managing physical training routines, sessions, and exercises. It aims to be a comprehensive tool for athletes and trainers.

## Structure

### 1. Database (SQL Scripts)
Contains the schema and initial data for:
- Exercises
- Training Sessions
- Training Plans
- User Profiles

### 2. Backend (Java)
A robust REST API built with **Java 21** and **Spring Boot**, handling the business logic and database interactions.

### 3. Frontend (KMP)
A cross-platform user interface built with **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**, ensuring a seamless experience across web and mobile devices.

### Domain Model Highlights
The system is built on a scientifically-grounded domain model supporting:
- **Multi-disciplinary Training**: seamless integration of resistance, endurance, and mobility work.
- **Detailed Tracking**: Specialized metrics for different training modalities (e.g., tempo for lifting, zones for cardio).
- **Anatomy & Biomechanics**: Tracking of muscle groups, movement patterns, and joint articulation.
